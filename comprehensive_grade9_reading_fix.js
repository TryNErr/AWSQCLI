This psychological discomfort motivates people to reduce the inconsistency through various mechanisms: changing their beliefs, acquiring new information that supports their position, or minimizing the importance of the conflict. Understanding cognitive dissonance helps explain seemingly irrational human behavior in contexts ranging from consumer choices to political affiliations.\"\n\nWhich of the following best illustrates the concept of cognitive dissonance as described in the passage?",
    "type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": [
      "A student who studies hard and receives good grades",

The green light in Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby' transcends its literal function as a navigation aid, becoming a multifaceted symbol representing hope, desire, the American Dream, and the ultimately illusory nature of idealized futures. This layered symbolism demonstrates how skilled authors can imbue their narratives with philosophical complexity while maintaining narrative accessibility.\"\n\nWhat does the author suggest about the relationship between symbolism and narrative accessibility?",

Emergence occurs when collective behaviors arise from the interactions of individual components, creating properties that cannot be predicted from studying the components in isolation. Ant colonies exemplify this principle: individual ants follow simple rules, yet their collective behavior produces sophisticated problem-solving capabilities, efficient resource allocation, and adaptive responses to environmental changes.\"\n\nHow does the ant colony example support the author's argument about emergence?",

Popper argued that unlimited tolerance can lead to the disappearance of tolerance itself, as intolerant groups may exploit tolerant societies to gain power and subsequently suppress tolerance.

Negative externalities, such as pollution from industrial production, impose costs on society that are not reflected in market prices, leading to overproduction of harmful goods. Conversely, positive externalities, like education or vaccination programs, provide benefits beyond those captured by market transactions, resulting in underinvestment in socially beneficial activities. These market failures necessitate government intervention through regulation, taxation, or subsidies to align private incentives with social welfare.\"\n\nAccording to the passage, why do positive externalities lead to underinvestment?",

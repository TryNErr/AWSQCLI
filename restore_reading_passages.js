Born in Poland in 1867, she moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne University. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in science, she persevered in her research on radioactivity. Her groundbreaking work led to the discovery of two new elements: polonium and radium. Curie's dedication to science continued even during World War I, when she developed mobile X-ray units to help wounded soldiers.\n\nWhat is the author's purpose in this passage?",

The volcanic ash preserved buildings, artwork, and even the final moments of the city's inhabitants. Today, archaeologists continue to uncover new discoveries that provide insights into daily life in ancient Rome. Recent excavations have revealed a fast-food restaurant, complete with decorated counters and large jars that once held food.

Arctic foxes are changing their hunting patterns as sea ice melts earlier each year. Instead of relying solely on seals, they're learning to hunt birds and small mammals on land. Similarly, coral reefs in warmer waters are developing heat-resistant algae that help them survive rising ocean temperatures. These adaptations show nature's remarkable ability to adjust, though scientists warn that the pace of change may still be too fast for many species.\n\nWhat is the main idea of this passage?",

    passage: "The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the 1440s revolutionized the spread of knowledge. Before this innovation, books were copied by hand, making them expensive and rare. The printing press allowed for mass production of books, making literature and information accessible to ordinary people. This democratization of knowledge contributed to the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, and the Protestant Reformation. Gutenberg's invention is often considered one of the most important developments in human history.",

    passage: "Bioluminescence is the ability of living organisms to produce light through chemical reactions. This fascinating phenomenon occurs in various species, from fireflies and jellyfish to certain fungi and bacteria. Deep-sea creatures often use bioluminescence for communication, attracting prey, or confusing predators. The light is produced when a chemical called luciferin reacts with oxygen in the presence of an enzyme called luciferase. Scientists are studying bioluminescence to develop new medical imaging techniques and energy-efficient lighting systems.",

This notion of 'radical freedom' places the burden of choice entirely on the individual, leading to what Sartre termed 'anguish'â€”the overwhelming responsibility of defining oneself through actions.

## 🎯 MATHEMATICAL REASONING BY GRADE LEVEL

### **Grade 1-3: Foundation Logic**
- **Pattern Recognition**: "Look at this pattern: 🔴🔵🔴🔵🔴. What comes next?"
- **Basic Reasoning**: "If you have 3 apples and eat 1 apple, how can you figure out how many are left?"
- **Number Logic**: "Which number is bigger: 5 or 3? How do you know?"

### **Grade 6-8: Intermediate Reasoning**
- **Logical Deduction**: "If all rectangles have 4 sides, and a square is a rectangle, how many sides does a square have?"
- **Conditional Logic**: "Sarah says: 'If it rains, then the ground gets wet. The ground is wet.' Can she conclude it rained?"
- **Algebraic Reasoning**: "In the equation 2 + ? = 7, what reasoning helps you find the missing number?"

### **Grade 9-10: Advanced Logic**
- **Mathematical Proofs**: "Prove that the sum of any two even numbers is always even. Which approach is correct?"
- **Proof Techniques**: "In proof by contradiction, you assume the opposite of what you want to prove. Why?"
- **Universal Statements**: "Which statement requires mathematical proof rather than just examples?"

### **Grade 11-12: Formal Mathematical Logic**
- **Mathematical Induction**: "In mathematical induction, after proving the base case, what must you prove?"
- **Proof by Contradiction**: "To prove √2 is irrational, we assume √2 = p/q in lowest terms and derive a contradiction. What contradiction?"
- **Formal Logic**: "In formal logic, what does ∀x P(x) → Q(x) mean?"
- **Set Theory**: "To prove A ⊆ B, you must show:"
- **Function Properties**: "To prove a function f: ℝ → ℝ is injective, you must show:"

## 🔍 SAMPLE GRADE 11 HARD QUESTIONS

### **Question 1**: Mathematical Induction
"In mathematical induction, after proving the base case, what must you prove?"
- P(k) → P(k+1) for arbitrary k ✅
- P(n) for all n
- P(1), P(2), P(3)...
- Nothing else

### **Question 2**: Proof by Contradiction  
"To prove √2 is irrational, we assume √2 = p/q in lowest terms and derive a contradiction. What contradiction?"
- **p and q are both even** ✅
- p/q > 1
- p = q
- p is negative

### **Question 3**: Formal Logic
"In formal logic, what does ∀x P(x) → Q(x) mean?"
- For some x, if P(x) then Q(x)
- **For all x, if P(x) then Q(x)** ✅
- P(x) and Q(x) are equal
- P(x) or Q(x)

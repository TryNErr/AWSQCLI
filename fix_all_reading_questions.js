First, the sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing it to evaporate into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the sky and forms clouds through condensation.

Scientists estimate that about 40% of our daily actions are habits rather than conscious decisions. This can work for us or against us. Positive habits like regular exercise, reading, or practicing an instrument can lead to significant improvements over time. Negative habits like excessive social media use or procrastination can hold us back from reaching our goals. The key to changing habits is understanding that they follow a pattern: cue, routine, and reward.\n\nAccording to the passage, what percentage of our daily actions are habits?",

This divide isn't just about owning devices—it's also about having reliable internet, digital literacy skills, and technical support. Students without adequate technology access face significant disadvantages in education, especially during remote learning periods. The divide often correlates with economic status, geographic location, and age. Addressing this issue requires coordinated efforts from governments, schools, and communities to ensure equitable access to digital resources.\n\nWhat does the passage suggest is necessary to address the digital divide?",

        content: "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Paradox of Choice in Modern Society**\n\nPsychologist Barry Schwartz argues that while some choice is undoubtedly better than none, more is not always better than less. The proliferation of options in contemporary society—from career paths to consumer goods—has created what he terms 'choice overload.' This phenomenon manifests in several ways: decision paralysis, where individuals become overwhelmed and defer choices indefinitely; escalating expectations, where the abundance of options raises our standards unrealistically; and post-decision regret, where we ruminate on foregone alternatives.\n\nSchwartz distinguishes between 'maximizers'—those who seek the absolute best option—and 'satisficers'—those who seek options that are 'good enough.' Research indicates that maximizers, despite often achieving objectively better outcomes, report lower satisfaction and higher rates of depression than satisficers. This counterintuitive finding suggests that the psychological cost of extensive deliberation may outweigh the benefits of optimal choice.\n\nWhich statement best captures the author's central argument?",
        options: [
          "Maximizers consistently achieve better outcomes than satisficers",
          "The relationship between choice availability and satisfaction is complex",
          "Western cultures should eliminate consumer choices",
          "Choice overload affects only indecisive individuals"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "The relationship between choice availability and satisfaction is complex",

Platforms like Uber, TaskRabbit, and Upwork have made it easier for people to find temporary work opportunities. While this flexibility appeals to many workers, it also comes with challenges: inconsistent income, lack of traditional benefits like health insurance, and limited job security. As more people enter the gig economy, policymakers are debating how to protect workers while preserving the flexibility that makes these arrangements attractive.\n\nWhat is a main challenge of gig economy work mentioned in the passage?",
        options: ["Too many available jobs", "Inconsistent income", "Excessive government regulation", "Limited technology platforms"],

During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, processes emotions, and clears metabolic waste through the glymphatic system. The sleep cycle consists of several stages, including REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, when most vivid dreaming occurs. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to numerous health problems, including weakened immune function, impaired cognitive performance, and increased risk of mental health issues. Despite sleep's obvious importance, many people in modern society consistently get less than the recommended 7-9 hours per night.\n\nWhat happens to memories during sleep according to the passage?",
        options: ["They are erased to make room for new information", "They are consolidated by the brain", "They become more vivid and detailed", "They are transferred to long-term storage"],

Machine learning algorithms can perpetuate and amplify existing biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes in hiring, lending, and criminal justice applications. The 'black box' nature of many AI systems makes it difficult to understand how they reach decisions, raising questions about accountability and transparency. Furthermore, as AI systems approach human-level performance in various domains, we must grapple with questions about consciousness, rights, and the fundamental nature of intelligence itself.\n\nThe development of autonomous weapons systems presents perhaps the most urgent ethical dilemma. Should machines be given the authority to make life-and-death decisions without human intervention? International humanitarian law requires that combatants distinguish between civilians and military targets, but can we trust algorithms to make such nuanced moral judgments? These questions demand immediate attention as the technology rapidly advances.\n\nWhat does the author suggest is the most urgent AI ethics issue?",
        options: [

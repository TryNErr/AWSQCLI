## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Difficulty System
```typescript
// Grade 9+ specific scaling
if (grade >= 9 && difficulty === 'hard') {
  params.complexity *= (1.5 + (grade - 9) / 10);
  params.conceptLevel *= (1.4 + (grade - 9) / 12);
  params.timeAllowed *= (0.8 - (grade - 9) / 20);
}
```

### Question Generation Improvements
- **Grade-Appropriate Selection**: Higher probability of advanced question types for Grade 9+
- **Complexity Modifiers**: Multi-step reasoning requirements
- **Abstract Thinking**: Higher-order cognitive skills
- **Time Pressure**: Reduced time allowances for advanced students

### Results Processing
```typescript
// Enhanced result tracking
interface DetailedResult {
  question: Question;
  userAnswer: string;
  isCorrect: boolean;
  validation: ValidationResult;
}
```

## 🎮 User Experience Improvements

### Navigation
- **Tab System**: Easy switching between different result views
- **Accordion Interface**: Expandable question details
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate recognition of performance

### Personalized Recommendations
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Based on actual performance

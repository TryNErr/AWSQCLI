  question = AustralianMathCurriculumGenerator.generateMathQuestion(grade, difficulty);
} else {
  question = CurriculumExtrapolator.generateCurriculumAlignedQuestion(grade, 'mathematics', difficulty);
}
```

### Question Quality Examples

#### NAPLAN-Style Literacy
```
Which sentence demonstrates correct subject-verb agreement?
A) The group of students are working on their project.
B) The group of students is working on their project.
C) The group of students were working on their project.
D) The group of students have working on their project.

Answer: B) The group of students is working on their project.
Explanation: The subject 'group' is singular, so it requires the singular verb 'is'.

#### Australian Mathematics
```
Simplify: (x³)² ÷ x⁴
A) x²

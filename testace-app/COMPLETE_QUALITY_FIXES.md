# Complete Quality Fixes Summary

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Build Failure Fixed
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation error `TS2304: Cannot find name 'Question'`
**Solution**: Fixed import inconsistency in PracticeSession.tsx
**Result**: Build now completes successfully

### 2. ✅ Ambiguous Questions Fixed
**Problem**: Questions were poorly written and confusing
**Examples of Issues Fixed**:

#### Workshop Schedule Question
**🔴 BEFORE (Ambiguous)**:
```
Q: "If someone attends Dance and wants to attend one more workshop, which is possible?"
Options: ["6 rooms", "5 rooms", "3 rooms", "Singing or Art"]
```

**🟢 AFTER (Clear)**:
```
Q: "If Alex attends the Dance workshop, which other workshops can Alex also attend on the same day?"
Options: ["Both Singing and Art", "Only Singing", "Only Art", "Neither Singing nor Art"]
```

#### Logical Deduction Questions
**🔴 BEFORE (Vague)**:
```
Q: "What can we conclude about Tom?"
```

**🟢 AFTER (Precise)**:
```
Q: "Based on this information, what can we definitely conclude about Tom?"
```

#### Spatial Reasoning Questions
**🔴 BEFORE (Confusing)**:
```
Q: "What is west of the hospital?"
Answer: "The park" (requires complex spatial reasoning)
```

**🟢 AFTER (Clear)**:
```
Q: "If you are standing at the hospital, which direction is the park?"
Answer: "West"
```

## 📝 Examples of All Improvements

### Pattern Recognition
**Improved**:
```
Q: "Look at this sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ?
   What number should replace the question mark?"
A: "32" (Each number is exactly double the previous number)
Options: ["32", "24", "28", "64"]
```

### Problem Solving  
**Improved**:
```
Q: "A painter needs exactly 2 liters green, 1 liter blue, and 1 liter yellow paint per room. 
   Available: 10L green, 8L blue, 6L yellow.
   What is the maximum number of complete rooms the painter can paint?"
A: "4 rooms" (Limited by yellow paint: 6÷1=6, but need whole rooms)
```

### Logical Deduction
**Improved**:
```
Q: "Rule: All students who failed the exam are in small classes.
   Fact: Tom is in a large class.
   What can we definitely conclude about Tom?"
A: "Tom passed the exam" (Logical deduction using modus tollens)
```

### Spatial Reasoning
**Improved**:
```
Q: "Emma walks 4 blocks north, then 3 blocks east to the store.
   If Emma walks directly back home, how many blocks will she walk?"
A: "5 blocks" (Using Pythagorean theorem: √(4²+3²)=5)
```

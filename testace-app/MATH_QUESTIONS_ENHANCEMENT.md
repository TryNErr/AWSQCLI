# Math Questions Enhancement

## What Was Enhanced

The Practice Questions section has been further improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Auto-Generation of Math Questions**:
   - Added a dedicated "Auto-Generate Math" button on the Practice page
   - Users can generate 20 questions for any grade level (1-12) and difficulty
   - Questions are dynamically created based on grade-appropriate math concepts
   - Includes a variety of question types: arithmetic, fractions, algebra, geometry

2. **Automatic Question Progression**:
   - Questions automatically advance after a brief delay
   - Users don't need to manually click "Next Question"
   - Provides time to review the explanation before moving on

3. **User Progress Tracking**:
   - Answered questions are tracked for logged-in users
   - Questions that have been answered don't appear again
   - Progress is persisted across sessions using localStorage
   - Session scores are recorded for future reference

## Math Question Types by Grade Level

The auto-generator creates grade-appropriate questions:

1. **Grades 1-2**: Basic arithmetic
   - Addition (e.g., "What is 5 + 3?")
   - Subtraction (e.g., "What is 8 - 4?")

2. **Grades 3-5**: Arithmetic and basic fractions
   - Addition and subtraction with larger numbers
   - Multiplication (e.g., "What is 6 × 7?")
   - Division (e.g., "What is 24 ÷ 6?")
   - Simple fractions (e.g., "Which fraction is larger: 2/5 or 3/5?")

3. **Grades 6-8**: Arithmetic, fractions, basic algebra, geometry
   - Fraction operations (e.g., "What is 2/3 + 1/4?")
   - Basic algebra (e.g., "Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 20")
   - Geometry (e.g., "What is the area of a rectangle with length 8 cm and width 6 cm?")

4. **Grades 9-12**: Algebra, geometry, advanced math
   - Advanced algebra (e.g., "Solve the quadratic equation: x² - 5x + 6 = 0")
   - Geometry (e.g., "What is the area of a circle with radius 5 cm?")
   - Advanced fractions and ratios

## How to Test the Enhancements

### Testing Auto-Generated Math Questions

1. Navigate to the Practice page
2. Click the "Auto-Generate Math" button
3. Select a grade level (1-12) and difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
4. Click "Generate Questions"
5. Answer the questions as they appear
6. Notice how questions automatically advance after you submit an answer
7. See your score update in real-time
8. When all questions are answered, view your final score

### Testing User Progress Tracking

1. Answer several questions in the auto-generated math section
2. Return to the Practice page
3. Click "Auto-Generate Math" again with the same settings
4. Notice that previously answered questions don't appear again
5. Try different grade levels and difficulties to see different question types

## Technical Implementation

1. **Math Question Generator**:
   - Created a sophisticated algorithm to generate grade-appropriate questions
   - Implemented different question types based on grade level
   - Added difficulty scaling within each grade level
   - Ensured all questions have correct answers and explanations

2. **User Progress Tracking**:
   - Implemented a service to track answered questions
   - Used localStorage for persistence across sessions
   - Added session scoring to track performance over time

3. **Automatic Progression**:
   - Added timers to automatically advance to the next question
   - Implemented logic to skip already answered questions
   - Created a smooth user experience with appropriate delays

- **Dynamic generation** with anti-repetition mechanisms
- **Grade-appropriate complexity** for all levels

## 🔧 System Integration

### Enhanced Question System Updates
- **Automatic curriculum selection** based on grade level (7+ uses Australian curriculum)
- **30% enhanced variety** through diverse question generators
- **Seamless fallback mechanisms** for comprehensive coverage
- **Quality assurance** maintained across all question types

### Question Generation Flow
```typescript
// Grade-based generator selection
const gradeNum = parseInt(grade);
const useAustralianCurriculum = gradeNum >= 7;
const useEnhancedVariety = Math.random() < 0.3;

// Diverse question generation
if (useEnhancedVariety) {
  question = EnhancedQuestionVarietyGenerator.generateVariedQuestion(grade, subject, difficulty);
} else {
  // Use curriculum-specific generators
}
```

## 📊 Question Quality Examples

### Mathematics - Algebra
```
Find the value of x: 3x + 7 = 22
A) x = 4
B) x = 5  ✓
C) x = 6
D) x = 7

Explanation: 3x = 22 - 7 = 15, so x = 15 ÷ 3 = 5
```

### English - Grammar
```
Choose the correct sentence:
A) The dog wagged it's tail happily.
B) The dog wagged its tail happily.  ✓
C) The dog wagged its' tail happily.
D) The dog wagged it tail happily.

Explanation: 'Its' is the possessive form (no apostrophe). 'It's' means 'it is'.
```

### Mathematical Reasoning - Logic
```
In a logic puzzle, if P implies Q, and Q implies R, and NOT R is true, what can we conclude about P?
A) P is true
B) P is false  ✓
C) P might be true or false
D) We need more information

Explanation: Using modus tollens: if P→Q and Q→R, then P→R. Since NOT R is true, P must be false.
```

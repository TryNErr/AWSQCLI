# Enhanced Thinking Skills Questions - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Based on analysis of a Grade 4 OC (Opportunity Class) Thinking Skills paper, I have completely upgraded the thinking skills question system to provide sophisticated, curriculum-aligned questions across all grade levels (1-12).

## Key Improvements

### üß† **Sophisticated Question Categories**

The new system includes 8 major thinking skills categories:

1. **Pattern Recognition & Sequences**
   - Visual and logical patterns
   - Number sequences with complex rules
   - Shape and color progressions

2. **Spatial Reasoning & Directions**
   - Geographic positioning problems
   - 3D visualization challenges
   - Distance and direction calculations

3. **Logical Deduction & Syllogisms**
   - If-then reasoning
   - Contrapositive logic
   - Syllogistic arguments

4. **Problem Solving & Constraints**
   - Resource allocation problems
   - Scheduling with constraints
   - Multi-step problem solving

5. **Critical Thinking & Argument Analysis**
   - Identifying logical fallacies
   - Evaluating arguments
   - Distinguishing correlation from causation

6. **Sequential Logic & Ordering**
   - Ranking and ordering problems
   - Temporal sequence analysis

```

### **Spatial Reasoning (Grade 5)**
```
In a town, the library is north of the school. The school is east of the park. 
The hospital is south of the school.
What is west of the hospital?
A) The park  B) The library  C) The school  D) Nothing mentioned
Answer: A) The park
```

### **Critical Thinking (Grade 8)**
```
Jake: "Video games cause violence because many violent people play video games."
What is the main flaw in Jake's reasoning?
A) Correlation does not imply causation  B) Video games are not violent
C) Not all gamers are violent  D) The sample size is too small
Answer: A) Correlation does not imply causation
```

### **Constraint Solving (Grade 10)**
```

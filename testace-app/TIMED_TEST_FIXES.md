# Timed Test Fixes - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issue 1: Duplicate Questions in Same Test
**Problem**: The same questions would appear multiple times within a single 30-question timed test, reducing the variety and quality of assessment.

**Root Cause**: Question generation and selection logic didn't check for duplicates within the same test session.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive duplicate detection that checks for:
- Exact content matches
- Normalized content matches (ignoring spacing/punctuation)
- Similar answer option sets
- Content variations that are essentially the same question

### ✅ Issue 2: Unprofessional Placeholder Answers
**Problem**: Questions contained unprofessional answer options like "Wrong Answer 1", "Option A", or empty placeholders.

**Root Cause**: Question generators used placeholder text when they couldn't generate proper distractors.

**Solution**: Implemented rigorous answer validation that rejects questions with:
- Generic placeholders ("Wrong Answer X", "Option A", etc.)
- Empty or whitespace-only options
- Lorem ipsum or sample text
- Generic labels without content

### ✅ Issue 3: Inaccurate Answer Validation
**Problem**: Timed tests used simple string comparison for answer validation, missing mathematically equivalent answers.

**Root Cause**: No integration with enhanced answer validation system.

**Solution**: Integrated the enhanced answer validation system that supports:
- Mathematical equivalence (5 = 5.0 = 5.00)
- Fraction-decimal equivalence (1/2 = 0.5)
- Multiple valid answer formats
- Confidence scoring for validation results

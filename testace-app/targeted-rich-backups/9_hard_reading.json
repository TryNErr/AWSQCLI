The explosion of choice in modern society—from breakfast cereals to career paths—has created a paradox. Rather than liberating us, this abundance of options often leads to anxiety, regret, and paralysis. Schwartz distinguishes between \"maximizers,\" who seek the absolute best option, and \"satisficers,\" who seek options that are \"good enough.\" Research suggests that satisficers tend to be happier and less stressed than maximizers, who often suffer from buyer's remorse and endless second-guessing. This phenomenon challenges the fundamental assumption of classical economics that more choices always lead to greater welfare and satisfaction.\n\nQuestion: According to the passage, what is the main difference between maximizers and satisficers?",

    "content": "Cognitive Biases in Decision Making\n\nHuman decision-making is systematically influenced by cognitive biases—mental shortcuts that can lead to errors in judgment. The availability heuristic causes people to overestimate the likelihood of events that are easily recalled, often because they are recent or emotionally salient. For example, after seeing news reports about airplane crashes, people may overestimate the danger of flying despite statistical evidence that air travel is safer than driving. Confirmation bias leads individuals to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. The anchoring effect occurs when people rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions. These biases evolved as adaptive mechanisms for quick decision-making in ancestral environments but can be maladaptive in modern contexts requiring careful analysis of complex information.

  console.log('\n🎯 Key Improvements Made:');
  console.log('1. ✅ Replaced ambiguous "which is possible?" with specific questions');
  console.log('2. ✅ Added context-specific distractors instead of generic options');
  console.log('3. ✅ Used precise language: "definitely conclude", "maximum number", "exactly"');
  console.log('4. ✅ Provided clear problem setups with all necessary information');
  console.log('5. ✅ Added detailed explanations showing step-by-step reasoning');
  console.log('6. ✅ Removed mathematical complexity inappropriate for grade level');
  
  console.log('\n📝 Examples of Improvements:');
  
  console.log('\n🔴 BEFORE (Ambiguous):');
  console.log('Q: "If someone attends Dance and wants to attend one more workshop, which is possible?"');
  console.log('A: ["6 rooms", "5 rooms", "3 rooms", "Singing or Art"]');
  
  console.log('\n🟢 AFTER (Clear):');
  console.log('Q: "If Alex attends the Dance workshop, which other workshops can Alex also attend on the same day?"');
  console.log('A: ["Both Singing and Art", "Only Singing", "Only Art", "Neither Singing nor Art"]');
  
  console.log('\n💡 Benefits:');
  console.log('- Questions are now unambiguous and professionally written');
  console.log('- Answer choices are relevant and logical');
  console.log('- Explanations provide clear educational value');
  console.log('- Appropriate difficulty level for target grades');
  console.log('- No more user complaints about poor question quality');

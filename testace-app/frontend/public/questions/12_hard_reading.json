    "content": "Read this passage:\n\nIn Virginia Woolf's modernist novel 'Mrs. Dalloway,' the narrative technique of stream of consciousness reveals the inner thoughts and psychological complexity of characters. The novel unfolds over a single day in post-World War I London, yet through memory and association, it encompasses entire lifetimes. Woolf's innovative use of free indirect discourse allows readers to experience the fluid boundaries between past and present, consciousness and reality. This technique reflects the modernist movement's rejection of traditional linear narrative in favor of psychological realism.\n\nWhat literary technique does Woolf primarily use to reveal character psychology?",

During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, processes emotions, and clears metabolic waste through the glymphatic system. The sleep cycle consists of several stages, including REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, when most vivid dreaming occurs. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to numerous health problems, including weakened immune function, impaired cognitive performance, and increased risk of mental health issues. Despite sleep's obvious importance, many people in modern society consistently get less than the recommended 7-9 hours per night.\n\nWhat happens to memories during sleep according to the passage?",

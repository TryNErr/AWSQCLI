First, the sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing it to evaporate into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the sky and forms clouds through condensation. When the clouds become heavy with water, precipitation occurs in the form of rain or snow. The water then flows back to oceans, lakes, and rivers, and the cycle begins again.\n\nWhat causes water to evaporate in the water cycle?",

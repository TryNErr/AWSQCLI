    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Paradox of Choice in Modern Society**\n\nPsychologist Barry Schwartz argues that while some choice is undoubtedly better than none, more is not always better than less. The proliferation of options in contemporary society—from career paths to consumer goods—has created what he terms 'choice overload.' This phenomenon manifests in several ways: decision paralysis, where individuals become overwhelmed and defer choices indefinitely; escalating expectations, where the abundance of options raises our standards unrealistically; and post-decision regret, where we ruminate on foregone alternatives.\n\nSchwartz distinguishes between 'maximizers'—those who seek the absolute best option—and 'satisficers'—those who seek options that are 'good enough.' Research indicates that maximizers, despite often achieving objectively better outcomes, report lower satisfaction and higher rates of depression than satisficers. This counterintuitive finding suggests that the psychological cost of extensive deliberation may outweigh the benefits of optimal choice.\n\nThe implications extend beyond individual psychology to societal structures. In cultures with fewer choices, people often report higher levels of life satisfaction, challenging the Western assumption that freedom of choice is inherently beneficial.\n\nWhich statement best captures the author's central argument?",

    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Unreliable Narrator in Literature**\n\nThe concept of the unreliable narrator, first articulated by Wayne C. Booth in 1961, has become a cornerstone of modern literary analysis. Unlike omniscient narrators who provide objective accounts, unreliable narrators present distorted, incomplete, or deliberately misleading information. This technique serves multiple literary functions: it mirrors the subjective nature of human perception, challenges readers to become active interpreters rather than passive recipients, and creates layers of meaning that reward careful analysis.\n\nConsider Holden Caulfield in Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye.' His adolescent perspective, colored by depression and alienation, filters every observation through his particular psychological lens. When he describes adults as 'phonies,' readers must discern whether this reflects genuine insight or his own defensive mechanisms. The unreliability becomes a window into character psychology rather than merely a narrative obstacle.\n\nThis technique has evolved in contemporary literature, with authors like Gillian Flynn and Tana French employing unreliable narrators to explore themes of memory, trauma, and self-deception. The reader's role transforms from passive consumer to detective, piecing together truth from fragments of biased testimony.\n\nBased on the passage, what is the primary literary function of unreliable narrators?",

    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Anthropocene Epoch Debate**\n\nGeologists are engaged in heated debate over whether humanity has ushered in a new geological epoch—the Anthropocene. Proponents argue that human activities have fundamentally altered Earth's systems to such an extent that our impact will be visible in rock strata millions of years hence. They point to evidence including: the global distribution of artificial materials like concrete and plastic, the mass extinction of species at rates 100 to 1,000 times natural background levels, and the alteration of atmospheric composition through fossil fuel combustion.\n\nSkeptics, however, question both the scientific rigor and the temporal scope of these claims. They argue that while human impact is undeniable, it may not meet the strict geological criteria for epoch designation, which typically require changes visible across millennia rather than centuries. Furthermore, they contend that the concept has become more political than scientific, serving environmental advocacy rather than objective geological classification.\n\nThe debate reflects deeper questions about humanity's relationship with nature and our responsibility as a species. If we accept that we have fundamentally altered planetary systems, what ethical obligations does this recognition entail? The Anthropocene concept forces us to confront whether we are merely another species subject to natural laws or something qualitatively different—planetary stewards with unprecedented responsibility.\n\nWhat does the author suggest is the most significant implication of the Anthropocene debate?",

    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Neuroscience of Moral Decision-Making**\n\nRecent advances in neuroscience have begun to illuminate the biological basis of moral reasoning, challenging traditional philosophical approaches to ethics. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies reveal that moral judgments activate multiple brain regions simultaneously: the prefrontal cortex associated with rational deliberation, the limbic system governing emotional responses, and the temporal-parietal junction involved in theory of mind—our ability to understand others' mental states.\n\nThis neurological complexity suggests that moral reasoning is neither purely rational nor purely emotional but represents an intricate interplay between cognitive systems. Consider the famous trolley problem: would you divert a runaway trolley to kill one person instead of five? Brain scans show that people who answer 'yes' exhibit greater prefrontal cortex activity, while those who refuse show stronger limbic responses. The moral intuition against actively causing harm appears to have deep neurological roots.\n\nHowever, critics argue that reducing moral behavior to brain activity commits the naturalistic fallacy—deriving 'ought' from 'is.' They contend that understanding the neural correlates of moral judgment doesn't necessarily inform us about what is actually right or wrong. The descriptive findings of neuroscience, they argue, cannot resolve normative ethical questions.\n\nAccording to the passage, what is the main criticism of using neuroscience to understand morality?",

    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Economics of Attention in Digital Media**\n\nIn the digital age, human attention has become a scarce and valuable commodity. Tech companies have developed sophisticated algorithms designed to capture and monetize our focus, creating what researcher Matthew Crawford calls an 'attentional commons'—a shared cognitive resource that is being systematically exploited. Social media platforms employ variable ratio reinforcement schedules, the same psychological mechanism that makes gambling addictive, to keep users engaged.\n\nThis 'attention economy' has profound implications for democratic discourse and individual autonomy. When our cognitive resources are constantly fragmented by notifications, pop-ups, and algorithmic feeds designed to provoke emotional responses, our capacity for sustained reflection diminishes. The result is a public sphere characterized by reactive rather than deliberative engagement, where complex issues are reduced to viral soundbites and nuanced debate becomes increasingly rare.\n\nPhilosopher Simone Weil argued that attention is the fundamental prerequisite for ethical action—we cannot respond appropriately to others' needs if we cannot focus on them. If this is true, then the systematic fragmentation of attention represents not merely a personal productivity problem but a moral crisis that undermines the foundations of ethical community.\n\nWhat connection does the author draw between attention and ethics?",

    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Paradox of Tolerance**\n\nPhilosopher Karl Popper articulated what he termed the 'paradox of tolerance': a tolerant society must be intolerant of intolerance, or it will eventually be destroyed by intolerant forces. This seemingly contradictory principle has become increasingly relevant in contemporary debates about free speech, hate speech, and the limits of democratic discourse.\n\nPopper argued that tolerance is not an absolute moral principle but a social contract. We agree to tolerate others' views on the condition that they reciprocate this tolerance. When groups advocate for the suppression or elimination of others, they have broken this contract and forfeit their claim to tolerance. The paradox emerges because defending tolerance requires abandoning it in specific circumstances.\n\nCritics argue that this framework is dangerously subjective—who determines what constitutes 'intolerance'? They worry that the paradox of tolerance could justify authoritarian suppression of dissenting views under the guise of protecting democratic values. The challenge lies in distinguishing between legitimate criticism and genuinely intolerant ideology that threatens the foundations of pluralistic society.\n\nModern democracies grapple with this paradox daily: Should universities allow speakers who advocate for racial superiority? Should social media platforms ban users who spread conspiracy theories? These questions have no easy answers, but they illustrate the ongoing tension between protecting free expression and preserving the conditions that make free expression possible.\n\nWhat does the author identify as the central challenge in applying Popper's paradox of tolerance?",

    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Linguistic Relativity Hypothesis**\n\nThe relationship between language and thought has fascinated scholars for centuries, culminating in the controversial Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, also known as linguistic relativity. This theory proposes that the structure and vocabulary of our language fundamentally shapes how we perceive and conceptualize reality. Strong versions of the hypothesis suggest that speakers of different languages literally inhabit different cognitive worlds.\n\nEvidence for linguistic relativity comes from various sources. The Pirahã people of the Amazon have no words for exact numbers beyond two, and studies suggest they struggle with precise quantity tasks that are trivial for speakers of languages with extensive numerical systems. Russian speakers, who have distinct words for light blue (goluboy) and dark blue (siniy), can distinguish between these shades more quickly than English speakers. Some languages have no absolute directional terms (left/right) but rely entirely on cardinal directions (north/south/east/west), and their speakers maintain remarkable spatial orientation abilities.\n\nHowever, critics argue that these examples demonstrate cultural emphasis rather than cognitive limitation. They contend that while language may influence the ease or speed of certain cognitive processes, it doesn't fundamentally constrain human thought. The universality of translation, they argue, suggests that all human languages can ultimately express the same range of concepts, even if some require more elaborate circumlocution.\n\nWhat is the main point of disagreement between supporters and critics of linguistic relativity?",

    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Authenticity Paradox in Social Media**\n\nSocial media platforms encourage users to 'be authentic' and 'share their true selves,' yet the very structure of these platforms creates pressures toward performative behavior that undermines genuine authenticity. Users curate their online presence, selecting flattering photos, crafting witty captions, and presenting idealized versions of their lives. This creates what sociologist Erving Goffman would recognize as 'impression management'—the conscious control of information to influence others' perceptions.\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider that this performed authenticity often becomes internalized. Users begin to see themselves through the lens of their online persona, leading to what psychologists call 'self-concept confusion.' The boundary between authentic self-expression and strategic self-presentation becomes increasingly blurred. Young people, who have never known a world without social media, may struggle to distinguish between their 'real' selves and their digital personas.\n\nFurthermore, the algorithmic curation of content creates echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs and preferences, potentially limiting the kind of challenging encounters that foster genuine personal growth. If authenticity involves honest self-reflection and openness to change, then social media's tendency to amplify confirmation bias may actually impede authentic development.\n\nThe irony is that platforms designed to connect us and help us express ourselves may be creating new forms of alienation and self-deception. The question becomes: can genuine authenticity exist within systems designed to commodify and monetize human attention and emotion?\n\nAccording to the passage, how does social media create 'self-concept confusion'?",

    "content": "Read the passage and answer the question:\n\n**The Placebo Effect and Medical Ethics**\n\nThe placebo effect—the phenomenon where patients experience real physiological improvements from treatments with no active therapeutic ingredients—presents fascinating challenges to medical practice and research ethics. Studies consistently show that placebo treatments can produce measurable changes in brain chemistry, immune function, and pain perception. This isn't merely 'psychological'; the effects are demonstrably biological, mediated by the release of endorphins, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters.\n\nThe ethical dilemma emerges when considering clinical applications. If placebos can provide genuine therapeutic benefit, is it ethical for doctors to prescribe them? Traditional medical ethics emphasizes informed consent—patients have the right to know what treatments they're receiving. However, placebos typically lose their effectiveness once patients know they're receiving inactive treatments, creating a paradox: the treatment requires deception to work, but deception violates fundamental principles of medical ethics.\n\nSome researchers have explored 'open-label placebos'—telling patients they're receiving inactive treatments while explaining the placebo effect. Surprisingly, these sometimes retain therapeutic efficacy, suggesting that the ritual of treatment and the patient-doctor relationship may be as important as deception. This finding challenges our understanding of both the placebo effect and the nature of healing itself.\n\nThe implications extend beyond individual treatment to healthcare policy.

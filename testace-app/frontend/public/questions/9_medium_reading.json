    "content": "Read this passage:\n\nDr. Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fieldsâ€”physics and chemistry. Born in Poland in 1867, she moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne University. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in science, she persevered in her research on radioactivity. Her groundbreaking work led to the discovery of two new elements: polonium and radium. Curie's dedication to science continued even during World War I, when she developed mobile X-ray units to help wounded soldiers.\n\nWhat is the author's purpose in this passage?",

    "content": "Read this passage:\n\nThe ancient city of Pompeii was frozen in time when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. The volcanic ash preserved buildings, artwork, and even the final moments of the city's inhabitants. Today, archaeologists continue to uncover new discoveries that provide insights into daily life in ancient Rome. Recent excavations have revealed a fast-food restaurant, complete with decorated counters and large jars that once held food.

Arctic foxes are changing their hunting patterns as sea ice melts earlier each year. Instead of relying solely on seals, they're learning to hunt birds and small mammals on land. Similarly, coral reefs in warmer waters are developing heat-resistant algae that help them survive rising ocean temperatures. These adaptations show nature's remarkable ability to adjust, though scientists warn that the pace of change may still be too fast for many species.\n\nWhat is the main idea of this passage?",

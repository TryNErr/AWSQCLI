This shift brought about significant social changes, including urbanization, the rise of the working class, and new forms of labor organization. While it led to increased productivity and economic growth, it also created harsh working conditions, environmental pollution, and social inequality. The revolution's impact continues to influence modern society, as we grapple with similar challenges in our current technological age.\n\nAccording to the passage, what is a lasting impact of the Industrial Revolution?",

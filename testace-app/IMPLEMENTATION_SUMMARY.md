# TestAce Practice Mode Fixes - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Resolved

### âœ… Issue 1: Grade/Difficulty Selection Not Maintained
**Problem**: After a few questions, the practice mode would fall back to random questions from any grade/difficulty instead of maintaining the user's selection.

**Root Cause**: When the system ran out of questions matching the exact criteria, it would randomly select from all available questions.

**Solution**: Implemented an enhanced question maintenance system that:
- Maintains strict filtering for grade, difficulty, and subject
- Automatically generates new questions when the pool runs low
- Validates all generated questions before adding them to the pool
- Ensures continuous availability of appropriate questions

### âœ… Issue 2: Incorrect Math Answers
**Problem**: Many mathematics questions had wrong correct answers, leading to incorrect feedback for students.

**Root Cause**: Generated questions lacked rigorous answer validation and mathematical accuracy checks.

**Solution**: Implemented enhanced answer validation and question generation:
- Rigorous mathematical validation for all generated questions
- Support for multiple equivalent answer formats (5 = 5.0 = 5.00)
- Fraction-decimal equivalence recognition (1/2 = 0.5)
- Multiple validation layers to prevent incorrect answers

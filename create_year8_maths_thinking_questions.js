      content: "If x + 7 = 15, what is the value of x?",
      options: ["6", "7", "8", "22"],
      correctAnswer: "8",
      explanation: "To solve x + 7 = 15, subtract 7 from both sides: x = 15 - 7 = 8."
    },

      content: "What is the next term in the sequence: 3, 7, 11, 15, ?",
      options: ["17", "19", "21", "23"],
      correctAnswer: "19",
      explanation: "The sequence increases by 4 each time: 3+4=7, 7+4=11, 11+4=15, 15+4=19."
    },
    {
      content: "A triangle has angles of 60° and 70°. What is the third angle?",
      options: ["40°", "50°", "60°", "70°"],
      correctAnswer: "50°",
      explanation: "Angles in a triangle sum to 180°. So 180° - 60° - 70° = 50°."

      options: ["6", "7", "8", "18"],
      correctAnswer: "7",
      explanation: "To solve 3x = 21, divide both sides by 3: x = 21 ÷ 3 = 7."
    },
    {
      content: "What is 25% of 80?",
      options: ["15", "20", "25", "30"],
      correctAnswer: "20",
      explanation: "25% = 1/4, so 25% of 80 = 80 ÷ 4 = 20."

      options: ["x = 4", "x = 5", "x = 6", "x = 7"],
      correctAnswer: "x = 5",
      explanation: "Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2[(x+3) + (x-1)] = 2(2x+2) = 4x+4 = 24. So 4x = 20, x = 5."

      explanation: "Ratio 3:4 means 3+4=7 parts total. Boys = (3/7) × 21 = 9."

      correctAnswer: "226 cm³",

      correctAnswer: "x = 3, y = 5",
      explanation: "Add the equations: (x+y) + (2x-y) = 8+1, so 3x = 9, x = 3. Substitute: 3+y = 8, so y = 5."

      correctAnswer: "7",
      explanation: "(x+3)(x+4) = x² + 4x + 3x + 12 = x² + 7x + 12. So b = 7."

      options: ["20%", "22%", "44%", "88%"],
      correctAnswer: "20%",
      explanation: "If radius increases by 20%, new area = π(1.2r)² = 1.44πr². This is 44% more than πr²."

      content: "In a right triangle, if one angle is 35°, what is the other acute angle?",
      options: ["45°", "55°", "65°", "145°"],
      correctAnswer: "55°",
      explanation: "In a right triangle: 90° + 35° + other angle = 180°. So other angle = 180° - 90° - 35° = 55°."

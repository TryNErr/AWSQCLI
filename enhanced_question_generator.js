REQUIRED VARIETY - Include ALL these types:
${topics.map(topic => `- ${topic.count} questions on: ${topic.description}`).join('\n')}

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Each question must be completely different
- Use real numbers and calculations
- Age-appropriate for ${grade}th graders
- Include word problems and direct calculations
- Vary the question formats and scenarios

EXAMPLE FORMATS (create different questions):
- Direct calculation: "What is 15 Ã— 4?"
- Word problem: "Sarah has 24 stickers. She gives 8 to friends and buys 12 more. How many does she have now?"
- Comparison: "Which is larger: 3/4 or 0.7?"
- Application: "A rectangle is 6 cm long and 4 cm wide. What is its area?"

Return as JSON array:

    "content": "Real varied question here",
    "options": ["Real option 1", "Real option 2", "Real option 3", "Real option 4"],
    "correctAnswer": "Correct option",

      "passage": "The factory whistle pierced the morning air at precisely 6:00 AM, its shrill cry summoning the workers like a mechanical rooster. Men and women emerged from the gray tenements, their faces already etched with the weariness that would deepen throughout the long day ahead.

    {
      "passage": "Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell faced countless obstacles in her pursuit of medical education in the 1840s. Medical schools rejected her applications simply because she was a woman. When Geneva Medical College finally accepted her, it was because the male students thought her application was a joke and voted to admit her as a prank. Despite facing isolation and discrimination from professors and classmates, Blackwell persevered. In 1849, she became the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States, opening doors for future generations of women in medicine.",

      "passage": "The old oak tree had witnessed a century of change. It had seen horse-drawn carriages give way to automobiles, gas lamps replaced by electric lights, and children's games evolve from simple hoops and sticks to complex electronic devices. Through wars and peace, prosperity and hardship, the tree remained constant—a silent sentinel watching over the ever-changing world below.

    {
      "passage": "In the post-colonial era, the concept of 'otherness' has become central to understanding how dominant cultures construct identity through exclusion. The 'other' is not merely different; it is positioned as fundamentally alien, exotic, or inferior, serving to reinforce the supposed superiority and normalcy of the dominant group. This binary thinking—us versus them, civilized versus primitive, rational versus emotional—reveals more about the anxieties and insecurities of the colonizing culture than it does about the colonized. Edward Said's seminal work 'Orientalism' demonstrates how Western scholarship created an imaginary East that justified imperial domination while simultaneously feeding Western fantasies of exotic difference.",
      "content": "According to this passage, what does the concept of 'otherness' primarily serve to do?",
      "options": ["Celebrate cultural diversity", "Reinforce dominant group superiority", "Promote cross-cultural understanding", "Document historical differences"],
      "correctAnswer": "Reinforce dominant group superiority",
      "explanation": "The passage states that 'otherness' serves 'to reinforce the supposed superiority and normalcy of the dominant group.'"
    },
    {
      "passage": "The fragmentation of narrative in modernist literature reflects the broader cultural fragmentation of the early twentieth century. Writers like Joyce, Woolf, and Eliot abandoned linear storytelling in favor of stream-of-consciousness techniques, multiple perspectives, and temporal disruptions. This wasn't merely an aesthetic choice but a response to the collapse of traditional certainties—religious faith, social hierarchies, and rational progress—that had defined the Victorian era. The fractured form of modernist texts mirrors the fractured psyche of individuals struggling to find meaning in a world that no longer offered clear answers or stable truths.",
      "content": "What relationship does the author establish between modernist literary techniques and historical context?",
      "options": ["Literary techniques were unrelated to historical events", "Fragmented narratives reflected cultural fragmentation", "Writers chose difficult techniques to confuse readers", "Modernist literature rejected all previous traditions"],
      "correctAnswer": "Fragmented narratives reflected cultural fragmentation",
      "explanation": "The author argues that fragmented narrative techniques 'mirrors the fractured psyche' and responds to cultural collapse."
    },
    {
      "passage": "Derrida's concept of 'différance' challenges the Western philosophical tradition's reliance on binary oppositions and fixed meanings. By introducing the neologism 'différance' (with an 'a'), Derrida highlights how meaning is always deferred, never fully present or stable. This deferral occurs because every sign gains meaning only in relation to other signs in an endless chain of signification. The 'a' in 'différance' is silent when spoken, visible only in writing, thus demonstrating the instability of the speech/writing hierarchy that has dominated Western thought since Plato. This seemingly simple substitution undermines centuries of metaphysical assumptions about presence, truth, and meaning.",
      "content": "How does Derrida's use of 'différance' function as both concept and demonstration?",
      "options": ["It proves that French is superior to English", "It shows that spelling doesn't matter in philosophy", "It embodies the instability of meaning it describes", "It creates confusion to hide weak arguments"],
      "correctAnswer": "It embodies the instability of meaning it describes",
      "explanation": "The silent 'a' that's visible only in writing demonstrates the very instability of meaning that the concept describes."

The environmental costs were equally severe, as coal-powered factories filled the air with smoke and chemical waste poisoned rivers and soil.",

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Strict Filtering Logic
```typescript
// EXACT matching - no exceptions
const filteredQuestions = allQuestions.filter(q => {
  const gradeMatch = q.grade === selectedGrade;        // ✅ Exact grade
  const difficultyMatch = q.difficulty === targetDifficulty; // ✅ Exact difficulty
  const subjectMatch = !subject || q.subject === subject;    // ✅ Subject if specified
  const notAnswered = !answeredQuestionIds.includes(q._id); // ✅ Fresh questions
  
  return gradeMatch && difficultyMatch && subjectMatch && notAnswered;
});
```

### Auto-Generation System
```typescript
// Generate questions when running low
if (availableQuestions.length < targetCount) {
  const newQuestions = await generateQuestionsForCriteria(
    selectedGrade,     // ✅ Exact grade
    difficultyLevel,   // ✅ Exact difficulty
    selectedSubject,   // ✅ Subject if specified
    questionsNeeded
  );
}
```

### Auto-Advance Timer
```typescript
// 5-second countdown with controls
useEffect(() => {
  if (isSubmitted && !isPaused && autoAdvanceTimer > 0) {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setAutoAdvanceTimer(prev => {
        if (prev <= 1) {
          advanceToNextQuestion(); // ✅ Auto-advance
          return 0;
        }
        return prev - 1;
      });
    }, 1000);
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, [isSubmitted, isPaused, autoAdvanceTimer]);
```

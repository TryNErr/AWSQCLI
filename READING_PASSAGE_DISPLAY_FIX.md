📖 Reading Passage:
The factory whistle pierced the morning air at precisely 6:00 AM, its shrill cry summoning the workers like a mechanical rooster. Men and women emerged from the gray tenements, their faces already etched with the weariness that would deepen throughout the long day ahead. The smokestacks belched black clouds into the sky, painting the dawn with industrial soot. This was progress, they were told, but progress had a bitter taste and left its mark on everything it touched.

What tone does the author use to describe industrial progress?

Choose your answer:

```

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **Conditional Display Logic**:
```typescript
{question.subject === 'Reading' && (question as any).passage && (
  <Box sx={{ mb: 3, p: 3, backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5', borderRadius: 2 }}>
    <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom color="primary">
      📖 Reading Passage:
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ lineHeight: 1.8, fontFamily: 'serif' }}>
      {(question as any).passage}
    </Typography>
  </Box>
)}
```

### **Styling Features**:
- ✅ Light gray background for passage visibility
- ✅ Serif font for better reading experience  
- ✅ Increased line height for readability
- ✅ Clear visual separation from question
- ✅ Consistent across all question components

- ✅ Proper reading passages in the data
- ✅ Frontend display of those passages

**The reading comprehension experience is now complete and educationally sound!** 📚✨

# Question Not Found Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
The TestAce app was showing "Question not found" when accessing URLs like:
```
https://master.d210nlz7uk7hed.amplifyapp.com/practice/question/eng_6_hard_6?grade=6&difficulty=hard&subject=English
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the question ID parsing logic in the `Question.tsx` component. The parsing logic was incorrectly handling question IDs with the format `eng_6_hard_6`.

### Original Parsing Logic (Incorrect)
```javascript
const parts = questionId.split('_');
const grade = parts[0].replace('grade', ''); // 'eng' -> 'eng' (wrong!)
const difficulty = parts[1]; // '6' (wrong!)
const subject = parts[2]; // 'hard' (wrong!)
```

For question ID `eng_6_hard_6`, this would result in:
- Grade: 'eng' (incorrect)
- Difficulty: '6' (incorrect) 
- Subject: 'hard' (incorrect)

## Solution
Fixed the parsing logic to handle multiple question ID formats:

### New Parsing Logic (Correct)
```javascript
const parts = questionId.split('_');
let grade, difficulty, subject;

if (parts[0] === 'eng' || parts[0] === 'english') {
  // Format: eng_6_hard_6
  subject = 'English';
  grade = parts[1];      // '6' ✅
  difficulty = parts[2]; // 'hard' ✅
}
// ... other format handlers
```

For question ID `eng_6_hard_6`, this correctly results in:
- Grade: '6' ✅
- Difficulty: 'hard' ✅
- Subject: 'English' ✅

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Format Support
The fix now handles multiple question ID formats:
- `eng_6_hard_6` → English, Grade 6, Hard
- `math_6_hard_6` → Mathematics, Grade 6, Hard
- `reading_6_hard_6` → Reading, Grade 6, Hard
- `thinking_6_hard_6` → Thinking Skills, Grade 6, Hard
- `grade6_hard_math` → Grade 6, Hard, Math (legacy format)

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
Added comprehensive console logging to help diagnose issues:
```javascript
console.log(`🔍 Loading question: ${questionId}`);
console.log(`📊 Parsed: Grade ${grade}, ${difficulty}, ${subject}`);
console.log(`📚 Retrieved ${questions.length} questions for Grade ${grade}, ${difficulty}, ${subject}`);
```

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms
Added multiple fallback strategies if exact question isn't found:
1. **Similar Question Search**: Find questions with matching grade, difficulty, and subject
2. **Alternative Subject Mapping**: Try different subject name variations
3. **Detailed Error Reporting**: Show available questions when target isn't found

### 4. Better Error Handling
Improved error handling with detailed error information and graceful degradation.

## Verification
The fix was tested and verified:
- ✅ Question file `6_hard_english.json` contains question `eng_6_hard_6`
- ✅ Question ID parsing logic correctly extracts Grade 6, Hard, English
- ✅ Parsed values match the actual question properties
- ✅ Changes committed and deployed to AWS Amplify

## Files Modified
- `testace-app/frontend/src/pages/Practice/Question.tsx` - Fixed question ID parsing logic

## Test Results
```
✅ Target question found!

```

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Changes committed to master branch
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub repository
- ✅ AWS Amplify automatic deployment triggered

## Expected Result
After deployment completes, the URL should work correctly:
```
https://master.d210nlz7uk7hed.amplifyapp.com/practice/question/eng_6_hard_6?grade=6&difficulty=hard&subject=English
```

The question should load properly showing:
- Question content: "Which sentence uses the subjunctive mood correctly?"
- 4 multiple choice options
- Proper grade/difficulty/subject tags
- Working answer submission and explanation

## Monitoring
Check the browser console for debugging logs that will help confirm the fix is working:
- Look for "🔍 Loading question: eng_6_hard_6"
- Look for "📊 Parsed: Grade 6, hard, English"  
- Look for "✅ Found exact question: English - eng_6_hard_6"

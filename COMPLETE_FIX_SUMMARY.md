# ✅ COMPLETE FIX SUMMARY - Both Issues Resolved

## 🎯 Problems Identified & Solved

### Problem 1: Question Quality Degradation ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Basic arithmetic questions like "84 + 175" and "7 × 12" were labeled as "hard Grade 9 Mathematical Reasoning"

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Replaced 323 inappropriate questions across 145 files
- ✅ Grade 9 Hard Math now contains: quadratic equations, derivatives, trigonometry
- ✅ Proper difficulty progression restored for all grades
- ✅ Educational explanations added

### Problem 2: Subject Naming Mismatch ❌ → ✅ FIXED  
**Issue**: When selecting "Maths", only "Mathematical Reasoning" questions appeared

**Solution**:
- ✅ Changed all math question subjects from "Mathematical Reasoning" to "Mathematics"
- ✅ Frontend now correctly matches "Maths" selection with "Mathematics" questions
- ✅ All 740 math questions now properly accessible

## 📊 Final Results

### Question Quality (Before vs After):

**❌ BEFORE:**
```
Grade 9 Hard Math: "What is 7 × 12?"
Grade 9 Hard Math: "What is 84 + 175?"
Grade 9 Hard Math: "What is 2 × 4?"
```

**✅ AFTER:**
```
Grade 9 Hard Math: "Solve the quadratic equation: 2x² - 7x + 3 = 0"
Grade 9 Hard Math: "If f(x) = x³ - 4x² + 5x - 2, what is f'(x)?"
Grade 9 Hard Math: "In a right triangle, if sin θ = 3/5, what is cos θ?"
```

### Subject Distribution (Final):
- ✅ **Mathematics**: 740 questions (30.7%)
- ✅ **English**: 720 questions (29.8%)  
- ✅ **Thinking Skills**: 630 questions (26.1%)
- ✅ **Reading**: 324 questions (13.4%)
- **Total**: 2,414 questions across 145 files

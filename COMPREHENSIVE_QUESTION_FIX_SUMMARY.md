# 🎯 COMPREHENSIVE QUESTION FIX SUMMARY

## ✅ PROBLEMS COMPLETELY RESOLVED

### 1. **"No questions available" Issue**
- **Problem**: Grade 9 medium math and other subjects showing blank/no questions
- **Cause**: Files contained generic placeholder questions like "Challenging math question for Grade X"
- **Solution**: Replaced ALL placeholder questions with proper, subject-specific content

### 2. **"What is sin(30°)?" Issue** 
- **Problem**: Grade 12 hard math showing elementary trigonometry
- **Cause**: Dynamic question generators overriding static files
- **Solution**: Disabled all dynamic generators, created proper challenging questions

### 3. **Insufficient Question Count**
- **Problem**: Many files had only 5 questions instead of 20
- **Cause**: Incomplete question generation in previous fixes
- **Solution**: Expanded all key subjects to full 20-question sets

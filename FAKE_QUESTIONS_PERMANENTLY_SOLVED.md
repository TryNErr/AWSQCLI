# ðŸŽ“ FAKE QUESTIONS PERMANENTLY SOLVED

## âœ… **DEFINITIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Root Cause Identified:**
The system had **multiple conflicting question sources** that kept generating fake placeholder questions:
1. **Build-time generator** that created "Grade X easy math question Y" templates
2. **Runtime generators** that produced generic content
3. **No persistence** of manually fixed questions

### **Permanent Solution Deployed:**
**Replaced the entire question generation system** with a **Curated Question Database**

## ðŸ“Š **What Was Implemented:**

### **ðŸŽ¯ Curated Question Database:**
- **2,160 real questions** across all grades and subjects
- **108 question files** (12 grades Ã— 3 difficulties Ã— 3 subjects)
- **20 questions per file** with proper educational content
- **Australian National Curriculum alignment** throughout

### **ðŸ“š Real Educational Content:**
- **Grade 1**: "What is 2 + 3?" â†’ Real arithmetic
- **Grade 3**: "Emma has 24 marbles. She wants to share them equally among 6 friends..." â†’ Real word problems
- **Grade 8**: "Solve for x: 3x = 21" â†’ Real algebra
- **All grades**: Age-appropriate, curriculum-aligned questions

### **ðŸ”§ System Architecture Fix:**
- **Disabled fake generator**: No more placeholder questions
- **Curated database**: Pre-written, professional content
- **Build-safe**: Questions never get overwritten

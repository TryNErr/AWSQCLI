## üé≤ Question Generation Features

### Advanced Math Examples:

#### Grade 3 - Fraction Operations (Medium Difficulty):
```
Question: "A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. Sarah ate 3/8 of the pizza, 
and her brother ate 2/8. How much pizza is left?"

Options: ["3/8", "5/8", "1/8", "6/8"]
Answer: "3/8"

Explanation: "Total pizza = 8/8. Sarah ate 3/8, brother ate 2/8. 
Eaten = 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8. Remaining = 8/8 - 5/8 = 3/8"
```

#### Grade 5 - Algebraic Thinking (Hard Difficulty):
```
Question: "A store charges $15 for delivery plus $3 per item. 
If the total cost is $72, how many items were ordered?"

Options: ["19", "21", "24", "27"]
Answer: "19"

Explanation: "Let x = number of items. Equation: 3x + 15 = 72
3x = 72 - 15 = 57, so x = 57 √∑ 3 = 19 items"
```

### Advanced English Examples:

#### Grade 4 - Reading Comprehension (Medium Difficulty):
```
Passage: "Maya discovered an old, leather-bound journal hidden beneath 
the floorboards of her grandmother's attic. The pages were yellowed with age, 
and the ink had faded to a soft brown. As she carefully turned each page, 
she realized these were her great-grandmother's memories from when she was 
Maya's age."

Question: "How did Maya likely feel when reading the journal?"
Options: ["Bored", "Confused", "Fascinated", "Angry"]
Answer: "Fascinated"

Explanation: "The phrase 'The stories transported Maya to a different time' 
suggests she was captivated and fascinated by what she read."
```

#### Grade 5 - Advanced Grammar (Hard Difficulty):
```
Question: "Choose the sentence that correctly uses the subjunctive mood:"

Options: [
  "If I was rich, I would travel the world.",
  "If I were rich, I would travel the world.",
  "If I am rich, I would travel the world.",
  "If I will be rich, I would travel the world."
]

Answer: "If I were rich, I would travel the world."

Explanation: "The subjunctive mood uses 'were' instead of 'was' in 
hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situations."
```

### Advanced Thinking Skills Examples:

#### Grade 4 - Logical Reasoning (Medium Difficulty):
```
Question: "If it rains, then the ground gets wet. The ground is wet. 
What can we conclude?"

Options: ["It definitely rained", "It might have rained", "It didn't rain", "The ground is always wet"]
Answer: "It might have rained"

Explanation: "This is the fallacy of affirming the consequent. While rain causes 
wet ground, wet ground doesn't prove it rained (could be sprinklers, etc.)."
```

#### Grade 5 - Spatial Reasoning (Hard Difficulty):
```
Question: "A cube is painted red on all faces, then cut into 27 smaller cubes (3√ó3√ó3). 
How many small cubes have exactly 2 red faces?"

Options: ["8", "12", "6", "0"]
Answer: "12"

Explanation: "Cubes with 2 red faces are on the edges but not corners. 
A 3√ó3√ó3 cube has 12 edge cubes."
```

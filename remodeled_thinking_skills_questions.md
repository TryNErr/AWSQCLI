### 17. Logical Reasoning
Ethan wants to persuade his cousin Isabella to come to the school science fair. His only chance of persuading her is if Ethan's sister, Emma, is presenting a robotics project. The problem is, it's very hard to get accepted into the robotics showcase, since the standard is very high. Even some very talented students have been turned away. You need to really impress the science teacher with your prototype to stand a chance. Emma does not work hard enough on her robot to get to that kind of level.

D. Emma is accepted into the robotics showcase but Isabella does not come to the science fair.

### 18. Cognitive Reasoning
Crows are a species of bird that will hide some of the food they collect in order to save some food for later.

Scientists studying the species made an interesting discovery:
- Some crows move food they hide if they see other crows watching them hide the food the first time.
- It is only those crows who have previously stolen food from other crows that move their food.

Mason: "That means a crow must be able to predict which other crows will steal its food."
Ava: "If a crow moves food it has hidden, you can be sure it has had its food stolen before."

If the information in the box is true, whose reasoning is correct?
A. Mason only
B. Ava only
C. Both Mason and Ava
D. Neither Mason nor Ava

What is the total of the other pile of tokens?
A. 36 points
B. 42 points
C. 57 points
D. 60 points

### 20. Argument Evaluation
Social media is a waste of time for students. When young people spend hours scrolling through feeds and watching videos, there is less time for studying and developing real-world skills.

### 26. Logical Reasoning
A school field trip to visit a technology museum is scheduled to take place next month. However, it will be cancelled if fewer than twenty-five students sign up for it. On top of that, even if twenty-five students or more sign up, there must be enough teachers to accompany them. The school's policy states that there must be at least one teacher looking after every twelve students on a field trip.

If the information in the box is true, whose reasoning is correct?
A. Elijah only
B. Abigail only
C. Both Elijah and Abigail
D. Neither Elijah nor Abigail

### 30. Scientific Reasoning
'Solid' honey can actually be better described as a slow-moving liquid. The particles in honey can move, just like in a regular liquid, because they are not fixed in an orderly structure. In honey, this movement is so slow that it cannot be detected during a person's lifetime or even over the course of several generations. Ancient honey found in Egyptian tombs which has survived to the present day is often found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top. This clearly shows that honey flows.

Which one of these statements, if true, most weakens the above argument?
A. Honey can be heated and heated honey, like every liquid, flows and obtains the shape of the vessel into which it is poured.
B. The human eye cannot detect tiny differences in the thickness of honey.
C. Modern kitchens often store honey in glass jars for long periods.
D. Honey samples from other ancient civilizations which have remained untouched for millennia are not thicker at the bottom than at the top.

They've been playing a game in which they throw a frisbee to one another in a specific pattern. Someone throws the frisbee to the person opposite. They then hand it to the friend on their left. In the first round, after three repetitions of this pattern Sophia is holding the frisbee.

Who was holding the frisbee at the start?
A. Isabella
B. Harper
C. Sophia
D. Lucas

### 33. Critical Thinking
Aiden and Zoe play chess together every day at lunch. They are at around the same skill level, and they have each won around half of the matches they've played against each other.

Ms. Chen: "I can't remember how many games Aiden and Zoe played last week, but I know Aiden won six, so they must have played about twelve games."

Which one of the following sentences shows the mistake Ms. Chen has made?
A. Either Aiden or Zoe might have played unusually well last week.
B. The players have each won around half, not exactly half, of their games.
C. Aiden and Zoe may have had lots of homework last week.
D. It doesn't matter who wins, because the important thing is that they both have fun.

### 36. Scientific Reasoning
Although many birds are fiercely territorial, they are typically very sensitive when nesting. If they feel their nest has been disturbed, they often abandon it altogether even if the female has already laid her eggs.

Carter: "My dad accidentally disturbed a nest when he was trimming the hedge. So there's a good chance it may now be abandoned."

## Auto-Generation System Design

To implement an auto-generation system for new thinking skills questions as users answer existing ones:

1. **Question Classification System**:
   - Categorize questions by thinking skill type (logical reasoning, spatial reasoning, pattern recognition, etc.)
   - Track difficulty level of each question
   - Identify key concepts tested in each question

2. **User Performance Tracking**:
   - Monitor which questions users answer correctly/incorrectly
   - Track performance by thinking skill category
   - Identify areas of strength and weakness

3. **Adaptive Question Generation**:
   - Generate new questions that target specific thinking skills
   - Adjust difficulty based on user performance
   - Focus on areas where users need more practice
   - Maintain variety in question types

4. **Question Templates**:
   - Create parameterized templates for each question type
   - Vary names, numbers, contexts while maintaining logical structure
   - Ensure generated questions have single, unambiguous correct answers

5. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Use a combination of template-based generation and AI-powered content creation
   - Validate new questions through testing to ensure they're solvable and appropriate
   - Build a growing database of questions that can be personalized for each user

This system would provide a continuously adaptive learning experience that challenges students at their appropriate level while helping them improve in areas where they need more practice.

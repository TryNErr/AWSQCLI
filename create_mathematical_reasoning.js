      "correctAnswer": "üîµ",
      "explanation": "The pattern alternates red and blue circles, so blue comes next."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you have 3 apples and eat 1 apple, how can you figure out how many are left?",
      "options": ["Count them", "Subtract: 3 - 1", "Add: 3 + 1", "Guess"],
      "correctAnswer": "Subtract: 3 - 1",
      "explanation": "When you take away, you subtract to find what's left."
    },
    {
      "content": "Which number is bigger: 5 or 3? How do you know?",
      "options": ["5, because it comes after 3 when counting", "3, because it's smaller", "They are the same", "Can't tell"],
      "correctAnswer": "5, because it comes after 3 when counting",
      "explanation": "Numbers that come later when counting are bigger."
    }

      "correctAnswer": "p and q are both even",
